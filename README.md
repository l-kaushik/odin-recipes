# odin-recipes
This is my first website build while following the odin projects

Live preview: https://l-kaushik.github.io/odin-recipes/

# Description
* We have a file named "index.html" which is the homepage of this website.

* Then we have sub-folders with recipe name, and these folders also contains the .html file for their recipe page and also the required images too.

* There are corresponding .css for the styling.

NOTE:- I think to make this website more beautiful, but let's just leave it, so I can look back like from where I started.
